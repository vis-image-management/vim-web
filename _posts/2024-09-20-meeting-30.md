Please join us Friday, September 20th at 11 AM ET for the Visualization and Image Data Management meeting. We will be hearing from Will Moore about the OME 2024 NGFF Challenge.

The OME-NGFF project is an effort by a growing community to develop a bioimaging "next generation file format" suitable for distributed computing at scale. Over the summer of 2024, we have challenged ourselves to push towards migration from Zarr v2 to Zarr v3. We have been updating our process, specifications and software with the goal of generating a large, community-wide collection of sample datasets. This work is a significant step towards the next release of OME-Zarr and will help promote its adoption by the wider bio-imaging community.

Presenters: Will Moore is a software developer at OME and the University of Dundee.
