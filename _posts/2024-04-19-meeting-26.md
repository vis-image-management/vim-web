Please join us Friday, 04/19/2024 11AM ET, for a talk titled "Practical improvements to image sharing workflows in Minerva". 
A free and open-source tool, Minerva, has long been in use to render static single-page websites that share scientific images with collaborators and the public. New priorities have emerged from a growing number of users: embedding sample-specific metadata, generating similar pages for many samples, and exporting all channels with semi-automated contrast settings. New workflows and processes to address these needs emerged from a collaborative effort led by the data management and informatics teams at the LSP.

Presenters: John Hoffer is a software engineer at the Laboratory of System Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School. His work focuses on image processing, scientific visualization, and web development.
