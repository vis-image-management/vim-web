Please join us Friday, October 25th at 11 AM ET for the Visualization and Image Data Management meeting. We will be hearing from Jeremy Muhlich about the MCMICRO analysis pipeline.

Spatial 'omics has emerged as a breakthrough technology for understanding the types and states of cells in the intact environment of tissues and tumors. Subcellular resolution, high-plex tissue immunofluorescence is particularly promising because it builds on two centuries of histopathology and tissue biology, exploits the latest advances in computational microscopy, and links changes in protein levels to changes in morphology. To support standardized high-throughput analysis of this data type, our team developed MCMICRO: a Nextflow pipeline for processing cyclic imaging of large intact tissues to extract single-cell and sub-cellular features as well as whole-slide multi-gigapixel images with as many as 100 channels. I will summarize the current state of MCMICRO, provide our roadmap for future development, and detail a series of proposed enhancements to streamline data access for downstream visualization and visual analytics tools in addition to cloud-based operation.

Presenters: Jeremy Muhlich is Director of Software Engineering at the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School.
