Please join us Friday, 03/08/2024 11AM ET for a talk titled "Samui Browser - Performant Web-Based Interactive Visualization Tool for Spatially-Resolved Transcriptomics Experiments". 
Samui lets the user rapidly and smoothly visualizes their images anywhere without any need for them to download any software or even the images themselves. Samui achieves this without any use of a backend server, relying only on a static cloud storage. It also supports image annotations, which are exportable in the GeoJSON for fast sharing.

Presenters: Chaichontat Sriworarat (Richard) is a graduate student in neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine under the co-mentorship of Drs. Loyal Goff and Genevieve Stein-O'Brien. He's currently investigating the relationship between the cell cycle and brain development using single cell and spatial transcriptomics. He also enjoys making tools that addresses pain points that scientists encounter to make research more efficient and reproducible.
