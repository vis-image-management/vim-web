Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit health research organization that is speeding the translation of science into medicine.  We believe that high-quality, well-annotated data acts as the foundation of modern biomedical innovation. We dream of a world where people work together across institutional boundaries to meaningfully address major medical research problems.  We incubate new ways for diverse groups of people to practice research together.
