We develop novel computational methods to study and understand tissue micro-anatomy using spatial-omics data acquired via diverse technologies. Our method has implications in clinical diagnostics and allows for studying the fundamentals of biological systems. Currently, our major focus involves studying diabetic kidney disease in humans.
