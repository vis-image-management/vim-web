We present a hybrid multi-volume rendering approach based on a novel Residency Octree that combines the advantages of out-of-core volume rendering using page tables with those of standard octrees. Octree approaches work by performing hierarchical tree traversal. However, in octree volume rendering, tree traversal and the selection of data resolution are intrinsically coupled. This makes fine-grained empty-space skipping costly. Page tables, on the other hand, allow access to any cached brick from any resolution. However, they do not offer a clear and efficient strategy for substituting missing high-resolution data with lower-resolution data. We enable flexible mixed-resolution out-of-core multi-volume rendering by decoupling the cache residency of multi-resolution data from a resolution-independent spatial subdivision determined by the tree. Instead of one-to-one node-to-brick correspondences, each residency octree node is mapped to a set of bricks from different resolution levels. This makes it possible to efficiently and adaptively choose and mix resolutions, adapt sampling rates, and compensate for cache misses. At the same time, residency octrees support fine-grained empty-space skipping, independent of the data subdivision used for caching. Finally, to facilitate collaboration and outreach, and to eliminate local data storage, our implementation is a web-based, pure client-side renderer using WebGPU and WebAssembly. Our method is faster than prior approaches and efficient for many data channels with a flexible and adaptive choice of data resolution.</p>

Microscopy-based tissue imaging is commonly performed at a resolution sufficient to determine cell types but not detect the subtle morphological features associated with cytoskeletal reorganisation, juxtracrine signalling, or membrane trafficking. Here we introduce a 3D imaging approach with high-resolution 54-plex cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) using existing instruments and reagents that is able to characterize a wide variety of organelles and structures at sub-micron scale, cell morphology at the cellular level, while simultaneously quantifying millimetre-scale spatial features.</p>

Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding of biological tissues. However, handling uni- and multi-modal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large volumes of data, heterogeneous data types and the lack of unified spatially-aware data structures. Here, we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multi-platform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations, and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated via multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multi-modal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.</p>

When developing machine learning (ML)-based solutions in computational pathology one of the often underestimated but major challenges is to ensure their reproducibilty. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a new cloud-based repository within the US national Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), which provides more than 120 cancer image collections according to the FAIR principles and is designed to be used with cloud ML services. In our work, we investigated how the IDC and cloud ML services can be used in combination to facilitate reproducibility in computational pathology research. For this purpose we developed a use case, in which we trained and applied a tissue classification model to distinguish between healthy tissue and two different tumor subtypes. We used different datasets from the IDC and implemented our experiments using Google Colaboratory and Google Vertex AI Notebooks.
